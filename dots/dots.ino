/* Moving Dots for FastLED 3.0 or greater

By: John Burroughs

Modified by: Andrew Tuline

Date: Oct, 2014

This sequence moves LED's at different rates across the strip.

FastLED is available at https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

Note: If you receive compile errors (as I have in the Stino add-on for Sublime Text), set the compiler to 'Full Compilation'.
